# Prioritize & Minimize (P.A.M)

### A small AngularJS project to put some learnings into practice.

#### Learnings:
* ES6 with AngularJS
* Webpack
* Integrating ng-redux for inter-component communication
  * A huge shoutout to [Dima Grossman's](https://blog.grossman.io/) blog post on [Using Angular 1.5 with Redux](https://blog.grossman.io/angular-1-using-redux-architecture/) to help me get my sample going.

#### Ongoing Practice:
* Component based architecture 

#### What's next:
* Remove bootstrap, try hand with flexbox/css grid

#### To run:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
